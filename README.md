MLR Integration Testing
---

This project is a working set of integration tests that may be run against
the MLR project. The tests are written using JMeter to go against a live, local MLR
stack running on the Docker engine.

#### Running the MLR stack When not on the USGS network

Feel free to skip this section if you are on the USGS network.

The MLR project is a set of Docker images that are served from an Artifactory instance within the Water Mission Area's data center. Through a reverse proxy setup, users on the USGS network are able to point their Docker engine at the Artifactory instance using the internal address to pull images (e.g. `cidasdpdasartip.cr.usgs.gov:8447/mlr/mlr-legacy-db:latest`). As such, no routing magic needs to happen on the user's machine in order to pull the images needed. However, when not on the USGS network, a developer must still be able to pull hosted images from Artifactory. In order to accomplish this, we use a running NGINX Docker container as a reverse proxy for localhost to point to `https://cida.usgs.gov/artifactory/api/docker/owi-docker/v2/` to pull the needed Docker images. This is required because the Docker engine only will pull images against a host at the root context or at a specific port. Therefore Docker cannot pull from `cida.usgs.gov/artifactory/api/docker/owi-docker/v2/` but can from `localhost` which NGINX proxies to Artifactory.

Ensure that the script to pull the images is executable:

`$ chmod +x pull-containers.sh`

Then execute the script:

`$ ./pull-containers.sh`

The script will first create the SSL certificates needed by NGINX to serve as an SSL enabled reverse proxy. It will then launch NGINX, sleep for 5 seconds to give NGINX time to come up and then will use NGINX to pull the images. The script will then shut down NGINX.

The SSL certificates created are stored in the `ssl/` subdirectory. These certificates are part of the `.gitignore` file so they are not checked in.

### Launching the services

If you are using Docker Machine and your Docker engine does not run on localhost, before launching the service stack, make sure that you create and export the `DOCKER_ENGINE_IP` variable in bash, setting it to the IP address of your Docker VM. This ensures that the launch script properly sets up the mock S3 bucket also running in a Docker container by ending curl commands to it. Using the following command properly exports the variable in bash. Don't forget to substitute the name of your Docker machine in the marked portion of the command:

```
$ export DOCKER_ENGINE_IP=`docker-machine ip <machine name>`
```

Also, if you will be running the JMeter tests using the JMeter GUI instead of running the tests via a master/slave configuration with a secondary stack of JMeter containers, you will want to edit one or two other files.

First, if you are using Docker Machine, edit `configuration/local/local.jmeter.properties` and replace `localhost` with the IP if your Docker VM. You can get that by running `docker-machine ip <machine name>` and subtituting the name of your VM that is running the Docker engine. If you are running native Docker, you can skip this.

Second, edit `configuration/local/config/common/config.env`. In this file you will want to substitute the `water.auth.server` domain with the IP of your Docker engine. This will either be localhost if not running on Docker Machine or the IP of your Docker VM. You can get that by running `docker-machine ip <machine name>` and subtituting the name of your VM that is running the Docker engine.

In order to launch all of the required services, ensure that the "launch_services.sh" script is executable and run it:

```
$ chmod +x launch_services.sh`
$ ./launch_services.sh
```

This script uses the `docker-compose-services.yml` config file to launch the MLR stack as well as two helper containers. One is a mock SMTP server that is required for the mlr-notification service to run. The other is a mock S3 bucket that is also used by MLR services.

When run, the script will attempt to launch the entire MLR stack and will then test the stack health for four minutes. If within four minutes any of the containers running in the stack are still unhealthy, the script will bring down the stack. If you are experiencing issues with the stack not coming up properly, some of the things you may look into is whether or not you have allocated enough RAM to the stack. On my system, I allocate two CPUs and about 5GB of RAM to Docker. Once running, this is what the stack status looks like:

```
$ docker stats

$ docker stats --no-stream
CONTAINER ID        NAME                                    CPU %               MEM USAGE / LIMIT     MEM %               NET I/O             BLOCK I/O           PIDS

```

Given these specs, the stack starts and shows as healthy on my system in about 80 seconds.

Once the script has verified that all of the containers are running successfully, it will also create a mock S3 bucket in the S3 container and exit.

An abbreviated example of the script running looks like:

```
$ ./launch_services.sh

#### Destroying the MLR stack

Once you're finished testing or you'd like to recreate the MLR stack running in Docker, you can destroy the stack by running the `destroy_services.sh` script after ensuring that it is executable:

```
$ chmod +x destroy_services.sh
$ ./destroy_services.sh
$ ./destroy_services.sh

#### Launching JMeter slave servers

If you will be running JMeter tests using the JMeter GUI, you can skip this section.

In order to perform the integration tests on MLR, JMeter is launched in a master/slave configuration. First, we launch three JMeter slave containers that sit and wait for the JMeter master to come online and provide instructions for testing. Once the testing has completed, the output files are provided back to master and written onto the file system. At this point, more testing may be run or the slaves may be shut down.

In order to launch the JMeter slave containers, simply ensure the `launch_jmeter_servers.sh` script is executable and run it:

```
$ chmod +x launch_jmeter_servers.sh
$ ./launch_jmeter_servers.sh
```

If this is your first time launching these containers, Docker will build the JMeter image based on the Dockerfile located @ `jmeter-docker/base/Dockerfile`. This Dockerfile builds a JMeter Docker image using version 5.0 of JMeter downloaded from Apache.

You may see a warning about orphan containers if you're already running the MLR stack. You may disregard those warnings.

#### Destroying JMeter slave servers

Once your testing has completed or you'd like to bring down the JMeter slave servers, ensure that the `destroy_jmeter_servers.sh` script is executable and run it:

```
$ chmod +x destroy_jmeter_servers.sh
$ ./destroy_jmeter_servers.sh
$ ./destroy_jmeter_servers.sh

Bringing down JMeter server services...
Stopping mlr-integration-testing_jmeter-server-2_1 ... done
Stopping mlr-integration-testing_jmeter-server-3_1 ... done
Stopping mlr-integration-testing_jmeter-server-1_1 ... done

If you removed or renamed this service in your compose file, you can run this command with the --remove-orphans flag to clean it up.

```

You may see a warning about orphan containers if you're already running the MLR stack. You may disregard those warnings.

#### Running JMeter tests via JMeter GUI

Once the MLR stack and the JMeter slave servers are up and running, you can run the JMeter tests via the JMeter GUI. Running via the GUI is the easiest way to visualize and edit the current set of tests.

Ensure you have JMeter >= 5.0 installed on your system and from the root project directory, issue the following command:

`$ jmeter -p configuration/local/local.jmeter.properties`

We use this local properties file as a source for key value pairs to override the default properties in the JMeter tests. The reason is that the JMeter tests include hostnames that only make sense if running the JMeter tests from within the Docker stack network that's created when the services stack is launched. That's what we do when we run the master/slave configuration for JMeter but when running with the JMeter GUI, we end up using the IP address of the Docker engine itself (localhost or the IP address of the docker machine VM)

Once the JMeter GUI is loaded, you should be able to run any of the tests included in this project.

#### Running JMeter tests headless in master/slave configuration

Each integration test also comes with a shell script that launches. Once you have the service stack running and healthy and you've launched the JMeter slaves, you can run the testing script for any of the included tests.

For example, to run the test for the DDOT files, ensure that the script to do so is executable and then run it:

```
$ chmod +x tests/integrations/ddot/test_plan.sh
$ tests/integrations/ddot/test_plan.sh
Dec 12, 2018 10:15:09 PM java.util.prefs.FileSystemPreferences$1 run

Tidying up remote @ Wed Dec 12 22:15:26 UTC 2018 (1544652926912)
... end of run
```

What happens during the run is the shell script launches a master JMeter container, attaches it to the network that the jmeter and MLR services stack runs on, mounts necessary volumes for configuration files, input files and output directories, and runs the specified test by pushing the test out to the three JMeter slave nodes.

It then waits for the tests to be completed, gathers the output, puts it into the `tests/output` directory in the project and shuts down and removes the master JMeter container.

For the ddot test output, you'd go to `tests/output/ddot/jmeter-output`
